# ORGANIZATION
<!---------------------->
The 2 largest folders are `projects` and `exercises`.
  - `Projects`: Holds all of the larger programs. It often includes multiple files.
  - `Exercises`: Bite-sized and smaller in scope. Meant to emphasize a concept or a group of related concepts.
The macro folders (`projects` and `exercises`) are further organized by its respective course number (ie: `js_101`). All folders and files will use snake_case with a few exceptions. The `exercises` files will use a mix of hyphens and camelCase. A 2â€“char prefix will designate the local category of exercise followed by the camelCase file name. (ie: `e1-fileName.js` = Easy1 File)
