I PROBLEM
â€¢ \Inputs\: Loan Amount, Loan Duration, Interest Rate (APR)
â€¢ \Outputs\: Monthly Payment, Total Interest Rate Amount, Loan Duration

--- Additional Details
â€¢ Formula to calculate monthly payment:
  let monthlyPayment = loanAmount *
  (monthlyInterestRate / (1 - Math.pow((1 + monthlyInterestRate),
  (-monthlyDuration))));
â€¢ Assumptions: All the inputs are integers and not floats

II EXAMPLES/EDGE CASES
â€¢ User puts 0 for loan amount, APR and loan duration
â€¢ Negative numbers
â€¢ Dealing with floats (cents) b/c of rounding errors in floats

III DATA STRUCTURES
â€¢ messages object (opt) organizational use case

IV ALGORITHM
--- 1 SETUP
[00] create a var $$readline to bring in the 'readline-sync' module
[01] create a var $$messages to hold all the text messages of the
program (can also use a separate json file)

--- 2 HELPER FNS
[00] fn prompt
  [aa] add a => to all input statements
[01] fn isValidNumber(num)
  â€¢ returns Boolean. Checks to make sure all of these are true
  [aa] Convert $$ into a 'number'
  <bb> $$ is a value other than NAN
  <cc> $$ is an integer (Number.isInteger(num))
  <dd> $$ is a positive number > 0

--- 3 MAIN PROGRAM
A __ WELCOME USER
[00] Welcome the user to the mortgage calculator and
explain basic details of the program

B __ INPUT #1: LOAN AMOUNT
[00] Declare variable $$loanAmount
~01~ Loop: <while $$loanAmount is invalid>
  \aa\ Input: Loan Amount
  [bb] Assignment: $$loanAmount = input

C __ INPUT #2: LOAN DURATION
[00] Declare var $$loanTerm
~01~ Loop: <while $$loanTerm is invalid>
  \aa\ Input: Loan Term
  [bb] Assignment: $$loanTerm = input
[02] Assignment of transformed value: $$loanTerm = $$loanTerm / 12
  â€¢ This is to convert yearly term to monthly

D __ INPUT #3: INTEREST RATE
[00] Declare var $$interestRate
~01~ Loop: <while $$interestRate is invalid>
  \aa\ Input: interestRate
  [bb] Assignment: $$interestRate = input
[02] Assignment of transformed value: $$interestRate = $$interestRate / 100

E __ PLUG & OUTPUT
[00] function calculatePayment(loanAmount, APR, loanDuration) {
  let monthlyPayment = loanAmount *
  (monthlyInterestRate / (1 - Math.pow((1 + monthlyInterestRate), (-monthlyDuration))));
}
\01\ Output: Your monthly payment is ____ for the loanAmount of ___.
The total interest rate paid is ____.

F __ PLAY AGAIN?
~00~
  \aa\ Input: Play Again. Answer with 'y' or 'n'
  <bb> User response
    -- 'y': Jump to -- 3 Main Program and start again
    -- 'n': Exit program
    -- other: Jump to ~00~
