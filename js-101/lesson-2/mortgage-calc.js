// Problem:
/* Inputs: Loan Amount, APR, Loan duration
- Output: monthly payment, total interest rate paid and duration to pay off loan 
- let monthlyPayment = loanAmount * (monthlyInterestRate / (1 - Math.pow((1 + monthlyInterestRate), (-monthlyDuration)))); */

// Edge Cases
// - User puts 0 for loan amount, APR and loan duration
// - Loans that aren't for an integer number of years

// Setup readlinesync in node to have the user be able to input information
// Welcome the user to the mortgage calculator and explain basic details of the program
// Create a mortgage object to store the information
// Gather the 3 pieces of input from the user and store it in their own variable (property of an object)
// Check to see if the entered inputs are valid (number type and formatted according to the rules in the description)
// Convert inputs into a format that's usable by the equation (APR to months, remove $ and , from loan amount and convert it to cents, convert loan duration to months)
// Plug everything into the equation
// Convert outputs into human readable format and spit it back to the user
// Conditional: Ask the user if they want to perform another calculation

// Helper functions, modules, data structure
